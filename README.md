# Snake
Windows Snake is a classic arcade game where players control a growing snake and navigate it around the game board to eat food and avoid running into walls or the snake's own body. As the snake grows longer, the game gets progressively harder, challenging players to score as many points as possible before the snake crashes into an obstacle and ends the game.

## Gameplay:
- The player controls a snake that moves around the game board.
- The snake grows longer as it eats food that appears on the board.
- The player must avoid running into walls or the snake's own body, which results in a game over.
- The game gets progressively harder as the snake grows longer.
- The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible before the snake crashes into an obstacle.
